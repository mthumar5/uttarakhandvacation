									Munsiyari is surrounded by undulating vegetation, with mesmerizing views. Munsiyari, a charming village nestled among the snow-capped peaks of Pithoragarh, is snowbound for most of the year. 
									</p>



									<h2 class="anchor-title">Overview</h2>
									<p>
									Munsyari, a cluster of revenue villages, the whole territory named Munsiyari Tehsil and Sub Division in the Pithoragarh District of Uttarakhand, India. Munsiyari, with its unspoiled terrain bounded by high Himalayan peaks, is like nature's arena, where you can see the sunrise from and set behind the jagged peaks every morning and evening. Munsiyari is a local term for a snowy location. 
									<BR><BR>
									         It is a fast-growing tourism site on the banks of the Goriganga River, and mountaineers, glacier enthusiasts, high altitude hikers, and environment lovers. Munsiyari's residents are incredibly modest and go out of their way to ensure that all tourists are safe. You can see the sun-kissed Panchachuli peaks in all their glory, the starting point for treks to the Ralam and Milam Glaciers, as well as the Nanda Devi Peak.
									</p>
									
									
									
									<br><br>
									<h3><b>Location </b></h3>
									<p>
									Munsiyari is well linked to all of Uttarakhand and the towns of Northern India, so you can visit Munsiyari by road, train, and flight. 
									<BR><BR>
									         If you want to visit Munsiayri by road, you can avail from ISBT Anand Vihar, buses go to Champavat, Almora, and Tanakpur, and then cabs may be rented to get to Munsiyari. Taxis are also available from Kumaon to Munsiyari. Munsiyari is a long way from Delhi; hence a stop in Vijaypur, Chaukori, or Almora is recommended. A bus may also be taken from Pithoragarh, 135 kilometres away from Munsiyari.
											 <BR><BR>
											        Munsiyari may be reached by rail also. The two closest railway stations to Munsiyari are Kathgodam (275 kilometres) and Tanakpur (286 kilometres). These stations have a robust rail network that connects them to several major cities. Cabs and buses are available for hire from the station to Munsiyari.
													<BR><BR>
													       If you plan to reach Munsiyari by flight, Pithoragarh is the nearest airport; however, it is not an actual airport. Air India Regional flies to and from Pantnagar Airport regularly. The Indira Gandhi International Airport (New Delhi) is the closest airport to Munsiyari, roughly 652 kilometres and well connected to several Indian and international cities.
														   <BR><BR>

									</ul>
										
										
									<h3><b>Best time to visit </b></h3>
									<p>
										You can visit Munsiyari between March and June and September and October to experience the best.
										<BR><BR>
										          In January, the weather usually is mild, and you will feel it throughout the day. But from the evening you can feel the cold, so warm clothing is suggested for the travelers in Munsiyari. As a result, we recommend visiting Munsiyari between March and April.
										<BR><BR>
										With beautiful weather all year, the summer season provides tourists with a great chance to see a picture-perfect clear view of the peaks and various hiking possibilities. 
										<BR><BR>
										
										        Winter (November-mid March) is when the entire area is blanketed in snow, making it an excellent destination for couples and honeymooners. During the season, skiing and other snow sports may be enjoyed. Heavy rains and landslides may wreak havoc throughout the monsoon season, so tourists shouldn't come here in this particular time range.
